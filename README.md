# Capstone Project: "Best Car Dealership" around United States website

Project Details: A national car dealership with local branches spread across the United States recently conducted a market survey. One of the suggestions that emerged from the survey was that customers would find it beneficial if they could access a central database of dealership reviews across the country.

In this project, I have build a website that allows new and existing customers to look up different branches by state and look at customer reviews of the various branches. Customers will be able to create an account and add their review for any of the branches. By these functions, the management hopes this will bring transparency to the system and also increase the trust customers have in the dealership.
